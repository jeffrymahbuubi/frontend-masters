## Course Material

### Introduction

#### [1. Hiring Process & The Four Gatekeeper](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/getting-a-job-v3/blob/b0bb1ecfaeb0bb3e843942cd4e9e932332e319de/getting-a-job-v3-slides.pdf)

- **The User Matrix (a.k.a You and The Interviewer)**

  - **User Zero**: You
  - **User One**: ATS (Applicant Tracking System)
  - **User Two**: HR Managers
  - **User Three**: Developer Teams

- In a pre-IPO startup company, there will often be multiple interviews, possibly up to 4 or 5. In contrast, larger companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Google typically conduct a maximum of around 3 interviews.

- Most of the hiring processes nowadays utilize **Artificial Intelligence**. For example:

  - **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)**: These systems use AI to search for matching keywords related to the required skills for the company. ‚û°Ô∏è [Teal](https://www.tealhq.com/) is an ATS system recommended for checking your resume.
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Used during phone interviews, AI analyzes the recording of your call to assess your readiness, nervousness, tone, etc. This analysis may also be shared with other engineers. ‚û°Ô∏è To prepare, practice answering interview questions, and build your confidence.

- Nowadays, many companies, during the **third phase (User Three)** of the interview process, ask for more computer science knowledge. Additionally, during the coding challenge, they also evaluate code performance.

### Data-Driven Resume Building

#### [1.Resume](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/getting-a-job-v3/blob/b0bb1ecfaeb0bb3e843942cd4e9e932332e319de/getting-a-job-v3-slides.pdf)

- Ensure your resume is no more than three pages. Make it diverse and highlight your achievements. It should contain the following sections:
  - **Extensive Experience**
  - **Strong Technical Skills**
  - **Impressive Achievements**
  - **Leadership and Collaboration**
  - **Educational Background** or alternatively, **Open-Source Projects**
  - **Continuous Learning and Certifications**
  - **Recognition and Awards** (optional if not applicable)
  - **Diverse Projects**
    - Include projects that are in production, regardless of their size. If there are users utilizing it, it is more valuable than a project that is not live.
  - **Volunteering and Leadership**
  - **Publications** (e.g., articles on Hacker News)

#### [2. Technical Experience](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/getting-a-job-v3/blob/b0bb1ecfaeb0bb3e843942cd4e9e932332e319de/resume-template.pdf)

- Remember to limit your resume to a maximum of three pages, highlighting the items listed in the `resume-template`. You can leave out your **Education** if you believe it is not relevant to the job you are applying for. For example, if your background is in Biology and it does not pertain to the position.

- Currently, companies often ask for certifications. So, which certifications do you need? It depends on the company you are applying to, but if you need to choose, you can consider obtaining AWS and Microsoft Azure certifications.

- Try your best to avoid using **acronyms**.

- Start to be active in local communities. If that is not possible, you can engage in blogging, streaming, or sharing your knowledge in public communities.

- NOTE: **This resume is tailored for the American job market**, which emphasizes achievements over education. However, this may not be applicable in other countries, such as India, where education is given more prominence.

- How to overcome impostor syndrome? Get feedback on your projects, be public, and create projects that have users.

### Building a Career-Ready Github Profile

#### [1. Create a GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/getting-a-job-v3/blob/b0bb1ecfaeb0bb3e843942cd4e9e932332e319de/resume-template.pdf)

- A GitHub Project Board: You can visit the [Dev Persona Questions project board](https://github.com/orgs/Vets-Who-Code/projects/85/views/1), which is a template containing questions for answering your User Zero. Given the exercise:
